## Introduction

Welcome to the Image Steganography App, a project developed by [Madineni Monish](https://github.com/madinenii).
This application enables the concealment of confidential text messages within images through the use of steganography, which is the practice of hiding information within another seemingly harmless medium, like an image. For the development of this project, I harnessed the capabilities of Python and the tkinter library to craft the graphical user interface (GUI), while incorporating the stegano library to implement the steganography features. The application offers a straightforward interface for encoding text messages into images and decoding hidden messages from images.

## Features


-->Embed a text message within an image.
-->Retrieve a concealed message from an image.
-->preview images both before and after the encoding/decoding process.
-->Utilize an easy-to-navigate graphical user interface developed using tkinter.
-->Integrate smoothly with the stegano library for seamless steganography operations.

## Prerequisites

To run this app on your local machine, you'll need the following:

-->Python 3.x
-->The tkinter library (typically bundled with Python installations)
-->The stegano library, which can be installed by using the command:
  ```
  pip install tkinter stegano
  ```

## How to Use

1. Duplicate this repository on your local machine.
2. Ensure that Python and the necessary libraries are installed.
3. Execute the Stegnography.py script:
   ```
   python Stegnography.py
   ```
4. The application window will appear, offering functionalities to encode and decode messages.
5. For encoding a message:
   -->Select the "Open Image" button.
   -->Choose the desired image and input the message for concealment.
   -->Select "Save" to generate the encoded image.
6. For decoding a message:
   -->Choose the "Open Image" button.
   -->Pick the image containing the concealed message.
   -->Click "Show Data" to unveil the hidden message.
